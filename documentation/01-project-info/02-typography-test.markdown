# Typography

This file demonstrates the typography of *markdown* it will also
show how we highlight the syntax if you open it in the editor.

## Headers

Headers will be parsed and made bigger so it shows up clearly.

### Tables

| Feature | Description                                                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Header  | The header of the **table** is marked strongly                          |
| Table   |  The whole table is colored so you can easilly find it in your document |

#### Code Blocks

You can easilly add code blocks using the fence notation.
They will be highlighted just like the tables.

```java
public class Test {
    private String test = "Hello World"
}
```

  1. highlight the bullet for you
