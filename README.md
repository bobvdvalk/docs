# AnyScribble

## What?
AnyScribble is a tool set that allows developers to write documentation,
guides or books without leaving their comfort zone. You simply write
your documentation in an IDE-like environment and publish it using the
tools you are already familiar with.

## Why?
Because development is fun but most of us never get around to actually
documenting or writing about the projects. AnyScribble should motivate
developers to write more by integrating it into a workspace they are
familiar with.

## How?
AnyScribble consists of several components. The main part is the editor
an environment that allows a developer to easily write their content
and set up a distribution.

The second part of it is the integration with popular build platforms
like maven and gradle that allows developers to publish their documentation
together with their products.
