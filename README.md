# doc-project

> This project is still in it's inception phase. We are working on the
  documentation, vision, name and planning.

## What?
With this project we try to create a tool that allows developers to
write books or documentation for their project the way they are used to.

## Why?
Because development is fun but most of us never get around to actually
documenting or writing about the projects. doc-project should motivate
developers to write more by integrating it into a workspace they are
familiar with.

## How?
doc-project consists of several components. The main part is the editor
an environment that allows a developer to easily write their content
and set up a distribution.

The second part of it is the integration with popular build platforms
like maven and gradle that allows developers to publish their documentation
together with their products.
