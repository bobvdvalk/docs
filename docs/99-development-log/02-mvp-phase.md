# MVP Phase
This phase we will try to deliver an [MVP](../02-minimum-viable-product.md).

## June 5th 2016
Today I started some work on the editor. I made a start on a tabbed
text view and the file manager. It still needs to be connected nicely
but the required public api is there.

The next thing I will do is take a look at a settings system so I can
store active projects and more settings.

## June 8th 2016
I implemented some UI operations like open file and open folder.
I also added the start of a editor toolbar. They still need icons and
the header levels still have to be implemented.

No updates on the settings system.
