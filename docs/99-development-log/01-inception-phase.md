# Inception Phase

## June 4th 2015
We just created the repository and set up the documentation. I have been
thinking about where to go with the project and waiting for @bobvdvalk
so we can discuss the name. So far we have the following options:

* **MauiDoc**: Named after a place in Hawaii. I think [@bobvdvalk] just 
  likes the sound.
* ~~**OmniDoc**: Meaning all round documentation.~~ Denied because of 
  [OmniDocs].
* **PolyDocumentor**
* **Omniscribble**
* **AnyScribble**

No reason to hurry the name just yet. We are still in the inception
phase.

## Available tools
I have also been doing some research to see what kind of tools we can use.

* [RichTextFX] or [AceEditor]
* [Pandoc]
* [Java Github API]
* [JGit]
