# Inception Phase

## June 4th 2015
We just created the repository and set up the documentation. I have been
thinking about where to go with the project and waiting for @bobvdvalk
so we can discuss the name. So far we have the following options:

* **MauiDoc**: Named after a place in Hawaii. I think @bobvdvalk just 
  likes the sound.
* ~~**OmniDoc**: Meaning all round documentation.~~ Denied because of 
  [OmniDocs].

No reason to hurry the name just yet. We are still
