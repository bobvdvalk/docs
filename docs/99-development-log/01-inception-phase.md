# Inception Phase

## June 4th 2015
We just created the repository and set up the documentation. 

### Project Name
I have been thinking about where to go with the project and waiting for 
@bobvdvalk so we can discuss the name. An issue was created to discuss 
this: [Issue 1]

No reason to hurry the name just yet. We are still in the inception
phase.

### Available tools
I have also been doing some research to see what kind of tools we can 
use.

* [RichTextFX] or [AceEditor]
* [Pandoc]
* [Java Github API]
* [JGit]
