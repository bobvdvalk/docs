# The Vision

The main goal of this project is to **build a tool-set that allows
developers to write and publish the way they are used to.**

This means that a develop should not have to learn complex new
technologies to be able to use AnyScribble.

Technologies required:

* Git
* Markdown
* Maven/Gradle

## Core Values

To evaluate features and design decisions we will stick with the following
core values.

### Developer Comfort
The first question we will ask ourselves is: Does a (Java) developer feel
comfortable with this decision?

Since this is the main goal of the project it is the most important value.

### Productivity
A tool should boost productivity. If a feature seems cumbersome or
impeding we should reconsider it. If a feature will improve the productivity
of a developer then it definitely belongs in this project.
